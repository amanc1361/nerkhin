# üöÄ Full-Stack Web App (Golang + Next.js SSR)

This is a **full-stack application** featuring:

- ‚úÖ Backend: [Golang](https://golang.org/)
- ‚úÖ Frontend: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
- ‚úÖ Dockerized infrastructure with **Nginx reverse proxy**
- ‚úÖ Automatic deployment using **GitHub Actions CI/CD**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

| Layer           | Stack                        |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Backend         | Golang                       |
| Frontend (SSR)  | Next.js (React)              |
| Reverse Proxy   | Nginx                        |
| Containers      | Docker & Docker Compose      |
| CI/CD Pipeline  | GitHub Actions               |

## üöÄ Deployment Flow

1. Push to the `main` branch triggers a GitHub Actions workflow
2. The entire project is securely copied to the server over SSH
3. On the server, `docker compose up --build -d` is executed
4. Nginx handles:
   - Routing between frontend and backend
   - Static asset caching
   - HTTPS (if configured with Certbot)

---

## üåê Routing

- `/` ‚Üí Forwarded to the **Next.js SSR frontend**
- `/api/...` ‚Üí Forwarded to the **Golang backend**

---

## üîê Server Requirements

- Linux server with SSH access
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- SSH private key (stored in GitHub Secrets)
- *(Optional)* Certbot + Nginx for HTTPS

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- Fully containerized (no need to install Go or Node.js on the server)
- Fast, secure, and SEO-friendly frontend
- Clean CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions
- Easy to manage, extend, and deploy

> Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è using Go, Next.js, Docker, and a love for clean architecture.
